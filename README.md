# CircleGAN
A basic Generative Adversarial Network built to learn the point mapping on generated 2D circles.

The following modules need to be installed before you can use the code. Using conda to the install will result in the least hassel.

``` 
conda install numpy
conda install matplotlib
conda install plotly
conda install pandas
conda install graphviz
conda install python-graphviz
conda install pydot
```
